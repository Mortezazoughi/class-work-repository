      <p>I was born in Tehran and migrated to US in early 1980s. In addition to academics, I participated in organized sports.
        I have been playing soccer since I was about 5 years old. In 1980s I attended a junior college prior to attending the
        university for degree program. As a member of the International Student Club, I and two other students, were able to obtain
        permission from the state and the president of the college to start a soccer team. I have obtained a real estate and insurance
        license in the state of Georgia and have been practicing real estate since 1995.
